# Chisfis Clone - React Application

This project is a clone of the [*Chisfis Nextjs website*](https://chisfis-nextjs.vercel.app/), built using modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, Zustand, shadcn, Zod, and React-Router. The goal of this project is to strengthen our skills in front-end development by recreating a full-featured, interactive website with a focus on best practices and modern tools.

## Projet overview

The **Chisfis Clone** project aims to replicate the functionality, design, and interactivity of the original Chisfis website. This includes building multiple pages, forms, user authentication, state management, and more. The objective is to practice and apply the skills acquired during our training at [worketyamo](https://worketyamo.com/) in React and consolidate our understanding of various front-end technologies.

Key aspects of this project:

- Interactive and dynamic UI built using React.
- Form validation and schema creation using Zod.
- Efficient state management using Zustand.
- Routing and navigation using React-Router.
- Styling and components with shadcn.
- Uses differents React hook such as useState, useEffect, useMemo, useContext, useCallback, customooks...

## Tech Stack

The following technologies are used in this project:

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the code.
- Zustand: Small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
- Zod: TypeScript-first schema validation library.
- React Router: Library for handling in-app navigation.
- shadcn: Modern design system and component library.
- Vite: Front-end build tool for fast development.
- Tailwind-CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for custom designs.
- pnpm and Yarn: for nodejs package management
